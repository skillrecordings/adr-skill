# ADR Conventions (Reference)

## Directory

If the repo already has an ADR directory, keep it.

If the repo has no ADR directory, choose based on project size:

- **`docs/decisions/`** — MADR default, recommended for projects with existing `docs/` structure.
- **`adr/`** — simpler alternative for smaller repos.

Detection order (used by scripts): `docs/decisions/`, `adr/`, `docs/adr/`, `docs/adrs/`, `decisions/`.

## Filename Conventions

Pattern: `NNNN-title-with-dashes.md`

- `NNNN` is a zero-padded sequential number (assume max 9,999 ADRs per directory).
- Title uses lowercase, dashes, present-tense imperative verb phrase.
- Examples: `0001-choose-database.md`, `0002-adopt-adrs.md`

If a repo already uses slug-only filenames (no numeric prefix), follow that convention.

## Minimal Sections

At minimum, every ADR must clearly include:

1. **Context**: why the decision exists now, what constraints/drivers apply.
2. **Decision**: what is chosen.
3. **Consequences**: what becomes easier/harder, risks, costs, follow-ups.

For agent-first ADRs, also ensure:
- Constraints are explicit and measurable
- Non-goals are stated
- Follow-up tasks are identified

## Status Values

Track status in YAML front matter:

```yaml
---
status: proposed
date: 2025-06-15
decision-makers: Alice, Bob
---
```

Common statuses:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `proposed` | Under discussion, not yet decided |
| `accepted` | Decision is active and should be followed |
| `rejected` | Considered but explicitly not adopted |
| `deprecated` | Was accepted but no longer applies — explain replacement path |
| `superseded by [ADR-NNNN](link)` | Replaced by a newer ADR — always link both ways |

## YAML Front Matter Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `status` | Yes | Current lifecycle state |
| `date` | Yes | Date of last status change (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `decision-makers` | Yes | People who own the decision |
| `consulted` | No | Subject-matter experts consulted (two-way communication) |
| `informed` | No | Stakeholders kept up-to-date (one-way communication) |

The `consulted` and `informed` fields follow the RACI model and are useful for audit trails in larger teams.

## Mutability

- Prefer appending new information with a date stamp over rewriting existing content.
- If a decision is replaced, create a new ADR and explicitly supersede the old one.
- Status changes and after-action notes are fine to edit in-place.

## Categories (Large Projects)

For repos accumulating many ADRs, use subdirectories:

```
docs/decisions/
  backend/
    0001-use-postgres.md
  frontend/
    0001-use-react.md
  infrastructure/
    0001-use-terraform.md
```

Numbers are local to each category. Choose a categorization scheme early (by architectural layer, by domain, by team) and document it in the index.

Alternative: use tags or a flat structure with a searchable index. Subdirectories are simpler and work with all tools.
