# Template Variants

This skill ships two templates in `assets/templates/`.

## Simple (Default)

File: `assets/templates/adr-simple.md`

Use this when:

- The decision is straightforward (there are not many credible options).
- You mainly need "why, what, consequences".
- You want low process overhead and high shipping velocity.

Roughly inspired by Michael Nygard's ADR sectioning (Status, Context, Decision, Consequences).

## MADR-Style (Options-Heavy)

File: `assets/templates/adr-madr.md`

Use this when:

- You have multiple real options and want to document tradeoffs.
- You want to capture decision drivers explicitly.
- You expect the decision to be revisited and want the comparison documented.

Roughly inspired by the MADR project template, but adjusted to be more "fill this out quickly" friendly.
